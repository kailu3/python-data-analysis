# Preface

This is a book documenting the useful things I've learned in CIS 105
Computational Data Exploration and well as useful Python snippets here and
there I like to use for data analysis.

## Who Is This Book For?

For students in CIS 105 and anyone looking for an easy introduction to learn Python for data analysis. My goal for this book is to provide an easy-to-reference guide for anyone looking to dabble in Python. For more advanced Python users, you may find the pacing to be slow. 

## Why Python?

Python has emerged over the last couple decades as a first-class tool for scientific computing tasks, including the analysis and visualization of large datasets. This probably may've come as a surprise to early proponents of the Python language: the language itself was not specifically designed with data analysis or scientific computing in mind. The usefulness of Python for data science stems primarily from the large and active ecosystem of third-party packages: NumPy \(_Pronounced num-pie_\) for manipulation of homogeneous array-based data, Pandas for manipulation of heterogeneous and labeled data, _SciPy_ for common scientific computing tasks, _Matplotlib_ for visualizations of data, _Scikit-Learn_ for machine learning, and many more tools in the following pages.


## Getting Help

While I would love to help everyone, time can be constraining. Usually, my advice is to Google it first which quite frankly in my
opinion is an improvable skill. There is a great quote from **Jake VanderPlas** on this (Author of Python Data Science Handbook):

> Being an effective practitioner of data science is less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you don't know, whether through a web search engine or another means.

## Contributing and Topic Requests

If you notice opportunities for improvements in terms of typos, spelling, grammar, syntax, etc., feel free to leave a comment on the right. You'll most likely be right.

If you have any topics that I could potentially go over or explain clearer and in more detail, please create an **issue** and describe the topic. You can create an issue [here](https://github.com/kailu3/python-data-analysis/issues). I'll try my best to address it as soon as possible.
