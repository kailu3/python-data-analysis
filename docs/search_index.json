My goal for this book is to provide an easy-to-reference guide for anyone looking to dabble in Python. For more advanced Python users, you may find the pacing to be slow. \nWhy Python?\nPython has emerged over the last couple decades as a first-class tool for scientific computing tasks, including the analysis and visualization of large datasets. This probably may've come as a surprise to early proponents of the Python language: the language itself was not specifically designed with data analysis or scientific computing in mind. The usefulness of Python for data science stems primarily from the large and active ecosystem of third-party packages: NumPy (Pronounced num-pie) for manipulation of homogeneous array-based data, Pandas for manipulation of heterogeneous and labeled data, SciPy for common scientific computing tasks, Matplotlib for visualizations of data, Scikit-Learn for machine learning, and many more tools in the following pages.\nContributing and Topic Requests\nIf you notice opportunities for improvements in terms of typos, spelling, grammar, syntax, etc., feel free to leave a comment on the right. You'll most likely be right. üòÅ\nIf you have any topics that I could potentially go over or explain clearer and in more detail, please create an issue and describe the topic. You can create an issue here. I'll try my best to address it as soon as possible.\nAcknowledgement\nHuge thanks to Arvind for hiring me as a TA and the folks at Shopify for inspiring this project as a Hack Days project.\n"},"getting-started.html":{"url":"getting-started.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Installation\nThere are multiple ways to install Python. The easiest way to do so is through the Anaconda distribution which comes in two flavours:\nAnaconda\nAnaconda is a very large installation (~3GB) and is most useful for users who are not familiar with installing modules or packages with other package managers. Choose Anaconda if you:\n\nAre new to conda or Python\nLike the convenience of having Python and over 150 scientific packages automatically installed at once\nHave the time and disk space\n\nYou can install Anaconda here. Make sure to get the Python 3 version.\nMiniconda\nMiniconda simply gives you the Python interpreter along with a command-line tool called conda which operates as a cross-platform package manager geared towards installing Python packages. Choose Miniconda if you:\n\nDo not mind installing each of the packages you want to use individually\nDo not have time or disk space to install over 150 packages at once\n\nYou can install Miniconda here. Make sure to get the Python 3 version.\nAn Alternative to Anaconda - pyenv\npyenv is a light-weight Python version management tool that lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. I prefer using pyenv for work and collaborating with others as it makes switching between Python versions rather convenient. If you are using a Mac, I suggest installing pyenv through Homebew (Mac package manager).\n\npyenv is totally not required for the purposes of CIS 105.\n\n"},"introduction-to-jupyter.html":{"url":"introduction-to-jupyter.html","title":"Introduction to Jupyter","keywords":"","body":"Introduction to Jupyter\nFor all of this book, we will be working in Jupyter Notebooks, which is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. I like to think of Jupyter Notebooks as the perfect medium for doing and sharing exploratory data analysis work. To me, Notebooks are the ideal sandbox for playing around with new ideas and tools.\nCreating Your First Jupyter Notebook\nDepending on how you installed Jupyter, there are several ways to open up a Jupyter Notebook. One of them is through the Anaconda Navigator if you installed through Anaconda.\nSimply open the Anaconda Navigator and launch the Notebook from there.\n\nYou can also open up the Terminal and run the command\njupyter notebook\n\nYou would now want to navigate to (or create) some folder where you would like to create your Notebook in.\n\nYou can create a Notebook from the right dropdown by selecting Python 3.\nAn Alternative to Jupyter Notebooks (Not Required) \nThe Jupyter team recently (2018) created a newer user interface that offers all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a more flexible and powerful interface. The project is called JupyterLab and essentially provides everything Jupyter Notebooks has but better (my opinion).\n\nI think CIS 105 is currently taught using Jupyter Notebooks so using JupyterLab is totally not necessary, but good to know that this exists.\n\nYou can get JupyterLab here.‚Äå\nIf you use Anaconda, you can install it with conda. Simply open Terminal and run\nconda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab\n\nIf you use pip, you can run\npip install jupyterlab\n\nTo open up JupyterLab, you similarly need to run\njupyter lab\n\n"},"tips-and-tricks.html":{"url":"tips-and-tricks.html","title":"Tips & Tricks","keywords":"","body":"Tips & Tricks\n"}}}
