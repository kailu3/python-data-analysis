# Installation

There are multiple ways to install Python. The easiest way to do so is through the Anaconda distribution which comes in two flavours:

## Anaconda

Anaconda is a very large installation \(~3GB\) and is most useful for users who are not familiar with installing modules or packages with other package managers. Choose Anaconda if you:

* Are new to `conda` or Python
* Like the convenience of having Python and over 150 scientific packages automatically installed at once
* Have the time and disk space

You can install Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). Make sure to get the Python 3 version.

## Miniconda

Miniconda simply gives you the Python interpreter along with a command-line tool called `conda` which operates as a cross-platform package manager geared towards installing Python packages. Choose Miniconda if you:

* Do not mind installing each of the packages you want to use individually
* Do not have time or disk space to install over 150 packages at once

You can install Miniconda [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Make sure to get the Python 3 version.

## An Alternative to Anaconda - pyenv

[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is a light-weight Python version management tool that lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. I prefer using pyenv for work and collaborating with others as it makes switching between Python versions rather convenient. If you are using a Mac, I suggest installing pyenv through Homebew \(Mac package manager\).

> pyenv is totally not required for the purposes of CIS 105.
